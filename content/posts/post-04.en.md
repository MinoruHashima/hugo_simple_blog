summary: "Since the 1960s, a bronze Peter Pan statue by sculptor Sir Cecil has stood in Dunedin Botanic Gardens, New Zealand. Katherine Lee, who posed as Wendy at age 9, went on to study at Oxford, run a small opera company, and eventually became a director of policy at the Ministry of Justice, receiving honors along the way. Now 68, Lee visited the statue for the first time earlier this week. A talk was also held at the gardens on Sunday. 'It was very nostalgic—like coming home,' she said."
