summary: "Starting February 5th, the Miura Coast Cherry Blossom Festival is being held around Miurakaigan Station and Komatsu-ga-Ike Park. Since around 1999, Kawazu cherry trees have been gradually planted, and today about 1,000 trees bloom along approximately 1km of railway tracks from Miurakaigan Station to the park. The event features a tent village with food stalls and a coupon campaign at local shops. Originally scheduled to begin on February 11th, the festival was moved up due to early blooming. It runs through March 3rd."
