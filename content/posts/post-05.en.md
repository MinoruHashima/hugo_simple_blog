summary: "Royal Star & Garter Homes, a charity providing care for veterans and their partners, celebrated its 110th anniversary with a letter from its patron, Princess Anne. The organization, which originally focused on caring for injured soldiers, now also provides dementia care and nursing support for an aging population. In 1948, it even participated in competitions with Stoke Mandeville Hospital, which later became the foundation for the Paralympic Games. Along with the letter, an oak tree—symbolizing strength and faith in the future—was planted."
