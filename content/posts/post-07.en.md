summary: "An angel's face in a fresco at a chapel in the Basilica of San Lorenzo had drawn attention for its resemblance to Prime Minister Meloni. The restorer in charge, Ventinetti (84), maintained that the restoration simply followed the original painting, while the PM commented, 'I certainly don't look like an angel.' However, as the controversy proved divisive, the church and the Ministry of Culture consulted and established procedures for future restorations. Ventinetti, who also originally painted the work in 2000, has now been tasked with whitewashing the face once again."
