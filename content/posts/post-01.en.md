summary: "Jacket potatoes—oven-baked potatoes topped with cheese, beans, and other toppings—first appeared in newspapers in 1846. Food businesses with 'spud' in their name have surged from 7 to 70 in just two years. SpudBros, founded in 2020, has become wildly popular thanks to social media, with customers lining up in droves. Even Subway has started selling them. SpudBros portions are reportedly quite generous. As experts say, 'Potatoes are healthy—as long as you don't overeat them.'"
