summary: "On January 5th, a dog stranded on a cliff face approximately 30 meters high was rescued in Trefor, Wales. A passerby spotted the dog stuck midway up the cliff. Coastguard cliff specialists rappelled down to confirm the dog was uninjured, then planned and executed a rescue. Once back at the top, the dog was safely reunited with its owner. The coastguard team that responded consists of local volunteers who have other primary occupations. How the dog ended up there remains a mystery."
